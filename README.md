Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator
This repository consists of three .js files with solutions of three toy problems: student grades, car speeding detection, and net salary.

Student Grade Generator
The Student Grade Generator prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following scale:The Student Grade Generator prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

A: Greater than 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40

Speed Detector
The Speed Detector program takes in the speed of a car as a parameter. If the speed is less than 70 it prints “Ok”. In this particular case, if the driver is 5 km/h over the speed limit (70), the program assigns him/her a negative demerit point and prints out the accumulated demerit points. If the driver secures a total point more than 12, it will display the message “License suspended”.

Net Salary Calculator
This tool is specifically known as the Net Salary Calculator because it uses the input of basic salary and benefits to estimate an individual’s net salary. This application is designed to determine tax, which is referred to as PAYE alongside other deductions like NHIF, NSSF, as well as the gross and net pay which are computed depending on the Kenyan tax and deductions.
